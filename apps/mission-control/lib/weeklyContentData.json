If your baby's around 4 months and suddenly sleep is HARD, I want you to know something: This isn't a step backwards. This is actually a LEAP.\"\n\nSETTING (3-8 sec): Leaning in, conversational\n\"Four months is when something huge happens in your baby's brain. Their circadian rhythm develops. Their sleep architecture changes. Their awareness of the world shifts.\n\nWhich means their sleep is going to look different now. It's not that YOU broke it. It's that THEY changed.\"\n\nSCRIPT/EXPLANATION (8-25 sec): Speaking with gentle authority\n\"Before 4 months: Your baby's sleep is pretty straightforward. Their nervous system is immature, so they kind of just... crash when they're tired.\n\nAfter 4 months: Suddenly they're AWARE. Aware of their environment, aware that you're not there, aware that sleep is a transition.\n\nAnd this is when sleep gets harder for like 2-4 weeks. Maybe longer.\n\nNight wakings increase. Naps get chaotic. They fight sleep. You feel like you've lost the plot.\n\nBut here's the thing: This IS progress, even though it doesn't feel like it.\"\n\nON-SCREEN TEXT: \"The 4-Month Regression\" | \"Your baby's brain is developing fast\" | \"This is progress, not a step back\" | \"It's temporary - 2-4 weeks usually\"\n\nCAPTION: \"The 4-Month Sleep Regression: It's Not What You Think 💙\n\nSo your baby was sleeping pretty well, and suddenly... total chaos. Welcome to the 4-month regression.\n\nHere's what's actually happening: Your baby's circadian rhythm is developing. Their sleep architecture is maturing. They're becoming AWARE.\n\nWhich means sleep is harder right now. And that's actually a sign of development, not a sign you've messed up.\n\nBefore 4 months: Sleep is simple (their nervous system is immature)\nAfter 4 months: Sleep is complex (they're aware now)\n\nThe regression usually lasts 2-4 weeks. Maybe a bit longer. And it FEELS like forever when you're in it.\n\nBut here's the truth: This is your window to help them learn to sleep THROUGH these new developmental stages.\n\nYou can't stop the regression. But you CAN help them through it with consistency, connection, and patience.\n\nIf your 4-month-old has suddenly become a terrible sleeper: You haven't failed. Your baby is just developing. And you're about to teach them something amazing. 🤍\"\n\nDETAILS: Week of Feb 17, 4-month regression education, developmental milestone timing",

PROTECT BEDTIME (Most Important)\nEarlier is often better during regressions\nConsistency is MORE important now\nDon't fight it - lean into routine\n\n2. LOWER EXPECTATIONS\nNaps might go chaotic (that's okay)\nNight wakings might increase (normal)\nThey might sleep LESS overall (temporary)\nDon't use this as justification to abandon routine\n\n3. INCREASE CONNECTION\nMore daytime cuddles\nMore responsive nights\nMore presence during the day\nThis is temporary - give them what they need\n\n4. PROTECT YOUR SANITY\nTake turns with your partner\nAsk for help (seriously)\nLower household expectations\nSleep when baby sleeps (yes, really)\nYou can't pour from empty cup\n\n5. KNOW THE REGRESSIONS\n4 months: Circadian rhythm develops\n8-10 months: Separation anxiety, crawling\n12-14 months: Language explosion, mobility\n18-24 months: Independence, molars\n2.5-3 years: Imagination, nightmares\n\n---\n\nWHEN TO GET HELP\n🚩 Regression lasts more than 6 weeks\n🚩 You're at breaking point\n🚩 Partner relationship suffering\n🚩 You're not coping emotionally\n🚩 Baby seems in pain/uncomfortable\n\nGetting help isn't failure.
