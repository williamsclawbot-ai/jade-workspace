# Revenue Impact: Nurture Sequence

## The Math (Why This Matters)

You're currently at:
- **260 subscribers** (free)
- **$4,000/month revenue**

**Problem**: 260 people opted in, but most aren't converting to paid guides. They're sitting in your email list, unmonitored.

**Solution**: The nurture sequence turns those 260 into active customers.

## Conservative Scenario (5% Conversion)

**Month 1** (Existing 260 subscribers)
- Conversion rate: 5%
- New customers: 13
- Average order: $37 (5-18 Month Guide)
- Revenue impact: **+$481**

**Month 2** (260 + new signups)
- New signups: 50
- Existing sequence conversions: 13
- Total new revenue: **$481 + $185 = $666**

**Month 3+** (Compounding)
- Running total subscribers: ~450
- Monthly conversions: 13 (existing) + 23 (new) = 36
- Monthly revenue: **$1,332**

**6-Month Revenue Impact**:
- Start: $4,000/month
- End: $4,000 + $1,332 = **$5,332/month**

## Realistic Scenario (8% Conversion)

With good copy (which you have), plus retargeting/reminders:

**Month 1**
- Conversions: 21 customers
- Revenue: **+$777**

**Month 2**
- Total conversions: 21 + 40 = 61
- Revenue: **+$2,257**

**Month 3+**
- Monthly conversions: 60+
- Monthly revenue: **+$2,220+**

**6-Month Revenue Impact**:
- Start: $4,000/month
- End: $4,000 + $2,220 = **$6,220/month**

---

## Optimistic Scenario (12% Conversion)

If social proof is strong, testimonials are real, and Email 4 resonates:

**Month 1**: +$1,332  
**Month 2**: +$3,330  
**Month 3+**: +$4,440+/month  

**6-Month Revenue Impact**:
- Start: $4,000/month
- End: $4,000 + $4,440 = **$8,440/month**

## Why This Actually Works

This sequence doesn't try to sell to everyone. It:

1. **Builds trust** (Email 1) — Jade's story + brand values
2. **Gives value first** (Email 2) — Proves expertise, no strings
3. **Identifies the pain** (Email 3) — Shows guides solve real problem
4. **Removes doubt** (Emails 4-5) — Social proof + objection handling

**Most nurture sequences fail because they pitch too early.** This one earns the right to pitch.

## One-Time Setup, Ongoing Revenue

- **Time to implement**: 20 minutes (just copy-paste into GHL)
- **Time to monitor**: 5 minutes/week
- **Time to optimize**: 1 hour/month after data comes in

**ROI**: Setup takes 1 hour. First month gains $481+ (conservative). That's $481+ per hour of work. Month 2 gains $666+. Month 6 gains $1,332+.

## What Gets Better Over Time

As you monitor metrics, you'll optimize:

- **Email subjects** — A/B test what gets opens
- **Copy tone** — Which voice converts more
- **Timing** — Are 2-day/5-day delays optimal?
- **Links** — Which product pages convert best
- **Testimonials** — Real customer quotes build trust

Each small improvement compounds across all 260+ subscribers.

---

## The Timeline

**Week 1**: You implement the sequence (20 min setup)
**Week 2**: First 40-50 emails send (Email 1)
**Week 3**: First conversions appear
**Week 4**: Data comes in, we optimize
**Month 2**: Sequence running on autopilot, new revenue flowing

---

## Bottom Line

**This is the fastest way to turn existing subscribers into money without:**
- Creating new products
- Launching new marketing campaigns
- Writing new copy from scratch
- Waiting for new traffic

You already have 260 people who said "yes" to you. This sequence just says "here's what we offer" instead of letting them sit in your email list forever.

**Expected year 1 impact**: $5k-10k additional revenue, depending on conversion rate.

## Next Steps

1. Review the sequence copy (adjust to match YOUR voice)
2. Grab actual customer testimonials for Email 4
3. Set up in GHL (15 minutes)
4. Monitor metrics for 2 weeks
5. Optimize based on what's working
