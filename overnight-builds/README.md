## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Can I use these emails as-is?
**A:** YES. All 3 sample emails are production-ready. Review for authenticity, make minor tweaks if needed, then import into GHL.

### Q: Do I need to follow the exact timing (Day 2, Day 4, etc.)?
**A:** The timing is optimized based on email marketing best practices, BUT you can adjust. Test shorter intervals (1-day instead of 2-day) if you want to move leads faster through the funnel.

### Q: What if my audience doesn't segment by child age?
**A:** Age segmentation (Stage 2, Email 4) is OPTIONAL but recommended. If you don't have age data, send a general "What to expect next" email instead of 4 variations.

### Q: Can I skip Stage 2 and go straight from Stage 1 to Stage 3?
**A:** NOT RECOMMENDED. Stage 2 is where HLS differentiates (partner alignment, vulnerability, trust-building). Skipping it will lower conversion rates.

### Q: How do I know if my emails sound "HLS enough"?
**A:** Use the Brand Voice Scorecard in `05-differentiation-strategy.md`. Target score: 35+ out of 40.

## 🎉 What Makes This Strategy Unique

This isn't just another email funnel. It's a **relationship-building journey** that:

✨ Treats parents as PEOPLE (not just "leads")  
✨ Addresses parental wellbeing as PRIMARY (not an afterthought)  
✨ Includes partners in the conversation (unique to HLS)  
✨ Uses vulnerability as a trust-building tool (Jade's authentic voice)  
✨ Reframes "failures" as learning (reduces parent guilt)  
✨ Provides flexible frameworks (not rigid rules)

**Bottom Line:** This strategy positions HLS as the **warm, human, responsive alternative** to clinical competitors like Baby Sleep Code and procedural competitors like Calm Babies.

## ✅ Ready to Launch

All deliverables are **production-ready**. No additional strategy work needed. Next step: **Implementation** (follow GHL Automation Plan).

**Estimated Time to Full Launch:** 2-3 weeks (including testing)
