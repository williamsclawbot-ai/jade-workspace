✅ No false choice between self-care & attachment  
✅ Realistic over perfect (anti-rigid)

✅ Proactive vs. reactive positioning

**Monthly Audit:** Review competitors' content; ensure HLS maintains unique positioning.

## Content Flexibility Notes:

80% planned content (this calendar)  
20% spontaneous/responsive content (real-life moments, trends, community needs)
