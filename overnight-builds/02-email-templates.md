### Copy Framework

**Hook Formula:**
- Option A: Validation + Question  
  _"You're not imagining it: [challenge]. But here's what's really happening."_
  
- Option B: Curiosity  
  _"This week, we're talking about [topic]—and why it changes everything."_
  
- Option C: Myth-Busting  
  _"What if I told you [common belief] isn't actually true?"_

**Body Framework:**

1. **Opening (50 words):**  
   Set context with a relatable scenario or question.  
   _Example: "Every parent I work with asks the same question: Why does my baby sleep great one night and terrible the next? If you've asked this too, you're not alone."_

2. **Story/Insight (200 words):**  
   - **Paragraph 1:** Share a personal story or common parent experience  
   - **Paragraph 2:** Reveal the insight (what's really happening)  
   - **Paragraph 3:** Connect to reader's situation (why this matters for them)

3. **Closing (50 words):**  
   Small, actionable takeaway or reflection.  
   _Example: "Tonight, before you start your bedtime routine, take 60 seconds to notice your baby's cues. You might be surprised what they're telling you."_

**Soft CTA Examples:**
- "Read more about responsive sleep methods →"
- "Share this with a tired parent who needs it"
- "Reply and tell me: Does this resonate?"
- "Save this for when you need the reminder"

### Personalization Guidelines

**Where to Personalize:**
- `[HLS LOGO]` → Use consistent branding
- `[WEEK'S THEME BAR]` → Rotate weekly themes
- `{Hook}` → Test 2-3 variations per email

- `{CTA}` → A/B test soft vs. softer

**A/B Test Opportunities:**
- Subject line (curiosity vs. validation)

### Copy Framework

**Hook Formula (Choose One):**
- **Fear-Based:** "I was terrified of [fear]."
- **Failure-Based:** "I'll never forget the night I [failed]."
- **Doubt-Based:** "I questioned everything I thought I knew about [topic]."

**Story Framework:**

1. **Opening (75 words):**  
   Set the scene vividly. Use sensory details.  
   _Example: "It was 3am. My daughter was 5 months old. I was sitting on the nursery floor, crying as hard as she was, convinced I was ruining her attachment because I'd let her cry for 10 minutes."_

2. **Conflict (100 words):**  
   The challenge, the fear, the internal struggle.  
   _Example: "Every expert I'd read said contradictory things. Cry it out. Never let them cry. Follow their cues. Stick to a schedule. I felt paralyzed. And worse—I felt like a failure."_

3. **Turning Point (75 words):**  
   What changed. The realization.  
   _Example: "Then my partner said something that shifted everything: 'What if there's no right answer? What if we just listen to her—and to us?' It sounds simple, but it cracked me open."_

4. **Resolution (50 words):**  
   How this shaped HLS.  
   _Example: "That night became the foundation of everything I teach now. Responsive sleep isn't about a method. It's about listening—to your baby, to yourself, and to what actually works for your family."_

5. **Reader Connection (50 words):**  
   Bring it back to them.  
   _Example: "If you've ever felt like you're failing, I want you to know: You're not. You're learning. And that's exactly what your baby needs you to do."_

**Soft CTA Examples:**
- "Reply to this email. I read every one."
- "You're not alone. Join the conversation →"
- "Screenshot this and save it for the hard nights."
- "Share this with someone who needs to hear it."

### Personalization Guidelines

**Where to Personalize:**
- `{Hook}` → Use different fears/challenges for different segments
- `{Opening}` → Reference child's age when known
- `{Resolution}` → Tie to relevant HLS product/philosophy
- Signature → First name only for intimacy

**A/B Test Opportunities:**
- Subject line (vulnerability level: high vs. medium)
- Story intensity (raw emotion vs. reflective)
- CTA tone (invitation vs. validation)
