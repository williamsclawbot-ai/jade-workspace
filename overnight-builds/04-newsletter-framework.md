---

## 5-Section Newsletter Template

---

## SECTION 1: Welcome (2-3 sentences, personal voice from Jade)

**Purpose:**  
- Humanize the brand
- Create intimacy
- Set tone for the email

**Format:**  
Short, conversational, personal. Opens like a letter from a friend.

### Examples:

**Example 1 (Vulnerability):**  
"Hi friend,  
I'm writing this at 6am with lukewarm coffee and a baby on my lap. Some weeks are like this—messy, imperfect, real. And I wouldn't have it any other way."

**Example 2 (Reflection):**  
"Happy Sunday.  
I've been thinking a lot this week about what it means to be 'enough' as a parent. Spoiler: You already are."

**Example 3 (Direct):**  
"Let's talk about something no one wants to admit:  
Parenting is hard. Sleep deprivation is real. And you're allowed to struggle."

**Example 4 (Seasonal/Contextual):**  
"It's Monday morning, and I'm guessing you're already tired.  
Before we dive into this week's strategy, I want you to know: Your exhaustion is valid."

**Example 5 (Question):**  
"Quick question:  
When was the last time you prioritized YOUR sleep?  
If you can't remember, this email is for you."

---

**WRITING TIPS:**
- Use "I" statements (builds connection)
- Name the reality (exhaustion, struggle, messiness)
- Set expectation for what's coming
- Keep it 2-3 sentences MAX

---

## SECTION 2: This Week's Reel Breakdown (1 reel deep-dive, why it matters)

**Purpose:**  
- Drive Instagram → Email integration
- Deepen reel content with more nuance
- Provide value beyond social media

**Format:**  
Reference the week's featured reel, then expand with:
- Why this topic matters
- Common misconceptions
- Deeper context (research, stories, examples)
- Actionable takeaway

### Template Structure:

**HOOK (1 sentence):**  
"This week's reel asked: [core question from reel]"

**EXPAND (2-3 paragraphs):**  
- Why this question matters
- What most people get wrong
- What the research/experience shows
- Real-world example or story

**CONNECT (1-2 sentences):**  
"Here's what this means for you..."

**ACTIONABLE INSIGHT (1 paragraph):**  
Specific, practical application

---

### Example (Based on Reel #1: "Your Sleep Matters Too"):

**HOOK:**  
"This week's reel asked a question most sleep consultants ignore: What about YOUR sleep?"

**EXPAND:**  
"Here's why this matters:

The baby sleep industry has conditioned us to believe that good parents sacrifice sleep. That self-care is selfish. That your needs come last.

But research tells a different story.

📊 Studies show:
- Sleep-deprived parents struggle with emotional regulation (Journal of Family Psychology, 2024)
- Parental burnout directly impacts attachment security (Developmental Psychology Review, 2025)
- Rested caregivers show higher responsiveness and attunement

Translation: When you rest, your baby benefits."

**CONNECT:**  
"This isn't permission to ignore your baby's needs. It's recognition that YOUR needs and your baby's needs COEXIST."

**ACTIONABLE INSIGHT:**  
"This week, I invite you to ask: 'What would change if I prioritized my sleep too?' Not in a month. Not after sleep training. Now."

---

**WRITING TIPS:**
- Reference specific reel (drives Instagram traffic)
- Go deeper than reel allowed
- Use data when possible (builds authority)
- End with one clear action

---

## SECTION 3: Parent Perspective (vulnerability/story from Jade or parent journey)

**Purpose:**  
- Build emotional connection
- Normalize struggle
- Show "you're not alone"
- Humanize the expert

**Format:**  
Story-driven. Either:
- Jade's personal story
- Anonymized client story
- Composite parent journey

**Structure:**
1. **Setup:** Introduce person/situation
2. **Struggle:** Name the hard part
3. **Insight:** What shifted
4. **Resolution:** Where they are now (or ongoing journey)
5. **Universal Truth:** "If this resonates, you're not alone"

---

### Example 1 (Client Story - Based on Reel #2: "The 3am Truth"):

**Title:** "Sarah's 3am Googling"

"Let me tell you about a client I'll call Sarah.

She came to me at month 6, barely holding it together. Sleep-deprived. Googling constantly. Feeling like she was failing.

'Everyone else's baby sleeps,' she said. 'What am I doing wrong?'

I asked her: 'Who is 'everyone else'?'

She paused.

'Instagram. My sister. That mom at playgroup who says her baby sleeps 12 hours.'

Here's what I told Sarah (and what I'll tell you):

**Everyone lies about baby sleep.**

Not maliciously. But selectively.  
The Instagram mom doesn't post the 4am wake-ups.  
Your sister forgot how hard months 3-6 were.  
The playgroup mom's baby might sleep 12 hours... but took 18 months to get there.

You're comparing your 3am reality to everyone else's highlight reel.

And it's making you feel like YOU'RE the problem.

**You're not.**

Baby sleep is hard. Biological. Developmental. Normal.

And you're allowed to struggle with it."

---

### Example 2 (Jade's Personal Story):

**Title:** "The Moment I Realized I Was Burned Out"

"I didn't see burnout coming.

I thought I was just 'tired like all parents.' I prided myself on pushing through. On being 'fine.'

And then one day, my partner asked me a simple question:  
'When was the last time you felt like yourself?'

I couldn't answer.

That's when I realized:  
I wasn't just tired.  
I was gone.

The version of me I recognized—patient, present, joyful—had disappeared under months of sleep deprivation and unacknowledged needs.

I had believed the lie:  
That good parents sacrifice themselves.  
That rest is selfish.  
That my needs could wait.

But they couldn't.  
And neither can yours."

---

**WRITING TIPS:**
- Use real details (builds authenticity)
- Name emotions clearly
- Show vulnerability (expert who's also human)
- Connect back to reader's experience
- End with validation or invitation

---

## SECTION 4: Resource (guide excerpt, research finding, or tool)

**Purpose:**  
- Provide tangible value
- Build authority
- Drive conversions (lead magnet → paid offer)

**Format:**  
Practical, actionable, save-worthy. Either:
- Downloadable guide (CTA to download)
- Research summary (with sources)
- Tool/framework (immediately usable)
- Checklist or worksheet

---

### Example 1 (Downloadable Guide):

**RESOURCE:** "5 Ways to Protect Your Sleep (Without Sleep Training)"

"Because you deserve rest that doesn't require rigid methods.

Inside this free guide, you'll get:  
✅ The 'Sleep Window' strategy (works even with frequent wakers)  
✅ How to ask for help (specific scripts that actually work)  
✅ Boundary-setting that supports attachment (not harming it)  
✅ The 'Both/And' framework for responsive rest  
✅ Science-backed sleep hygiene for parents (not just babies)

**[Download Free Guide →]**

This is your permission slip + action plan. Get it now."

---

### Example 2 (Research Summary):

**RESOURCE:** "What Science Says About Parental Rest"

"Here are 3 studies that completely shifted my approach:

**Study #1: Sleep Deprivation & Emotional Regulation**  
(Journal of Family Psychology, 2024)

Findings: Parents who slept <6 hours showed 30% reduction in emotional regulation capacity.  
Translation: Exhaustion makes you more reactive, less patient, more overwhelmed.

**Study #2: Parental Burnout & Attachment Security**  
(Developmental Psychology Review, 2025)

Findings: High parental burnout correlated with lower attachment security scores in children.  
Translation: When parents are depleted, babies sense it—and attachment suffers.

**Study #3: Caregiver Rest & Attunement**  
(Infant Mental Health Journal, 2023)

Findings: Rested caregivers showed significantly higher attunement in play interactions.  
Translation: When you rest, you're MORE present—not less.

**What This Means for You:**  
Your rest isn't selfish. It's strategic."

---

### Example 3 (Framework/Tool):

**RESOURCE:** "The Both/And Decision-Making Guide"

"When you're stuck between 'baby's needs' and 'my needs,' use this:

**EITHER/OR Thinking (OLD):**  
❌ I can respond to my baby OR rest  
❌ I can be gentle OR set boundaries  
❌ I can prioritize attachment OR self-care  

**BOTH/AND Thinking (NEW):**  
✅ How can I respond to my baby AND honor my need for rest?  
✅ How can I be gentle AND set a boundary that protects my wellbeing?  
✅ How can I support attachment AND prioritize self-care?  

**Try it this week:**  
Pick one parenting dilemma.  
Reframe it as both/and.  
Watch what shifts."

---

**WRITING TIPS:**
- Make it actionable (not just theory)
- Provide immediate value
- Use clear formatting (bullets, bold, headers)
- Include CTA if downloadable

## Sample Newsletter: Week 1, Wednesday

---

**SUBJECT:** What if YOUR sleep mattered too?

**PREVIEW TEXT:** The truth no one tells you about parental rest...

---

Hi friend,

I'm writing this at 6am with lukewarm coffee and a baby who decided 5:30 was morning. Some weeks are like this—messy, imperfect, real. And I wouldn't have it any other way.

But I also wouldn't have survived without learning this one truth: YOUR sleep matters too.

---

### This Week's Reel Breakdown: "Your Sleep Matters Too"

This week's reel asked a question most sleep consultants ignore: What about YOUR sleep?

Here's why this matters:

The baby sleep industry has conditioned us to believe that:
- Good parents sacrifice sleep
- Self-care is selfish
- Your needs come last

But research tells a different story.

📊 Studies show:
- Sleep-deprived parents struggle with emotional regulation (Journal of Family Psychology, 2024)
- Parental burnout directly impacts attachment security (Developmental Psychology Review, 2025)
- Rested caregivers show higher responsiveness and attunement

**Translation:** When you rest, your baby benefits.

This isn't permission to ignore your baby's needs.  
It's recognition that YOUR needs and your baby's needs COEXIST.

This week, I invite you to ask:  
**"What would change if I prioritized my sleep too?"**

Not in a month. Not after sleep training.  
Now.

---

### Sarah's 3am Googling

Let me tell you about a client I'll call Sarah.

She came to me at month 6, barely holding it together. Sleep-deprived. Googling constantly. Feeling like she was failing.

'Everyone else's baby sleeps,' she said. 'What am I doing wrong?'

I asked her: 'Who is 'everyone else'?'

She paused.

'Instagram. My sister. That mom at playgroup who says her baby sleeps 12 hours.'

Here's what I told Sarah (and what I'll tell you):

**Everyone lies about baby sleep.**

Not maliciously. But selectively.  
The Instagram mom doesn't post the 4am wake-ups.  
Your sister forgot how hard months 3-6 were.  
The playgroup mom's baby might sleep 12 hours... but took 18 months to get there.

You're comparing your 3am reality to everyone else's highlight reel.

**You're not the problem.**

Baby sleep is hard. Biological. Developmental. Normal.

And you're allowed to struggle with it.
