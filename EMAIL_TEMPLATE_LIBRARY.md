[GREETING]
Hi [First Name],

[HOOK - 1 sentence, emotional or curiosity-driven]
Example: "I used to think all baby cries meant the same thing. I was so wrong."

[STORY/CONTEXT - 2-3 paragraphs, first person from Jade]
- Personal experience or client story
- Vulnerability before advice
- Relatable struggle or challenge
- Emotional truth (fear, exhaustion, confusion)

Example:
"When Harvey was 3 months old, I'd hear him cry and immediately panic. Was he hungry? Tired? Uncomfortable? I had no idea. Every cry felt like a test I was failing.

Then one night, I slowed down. I listened. I noticed patterns. His 'tired' cry was different from his 'hungry' cry. His 'uncomfortable' cry had a rhythm. Once I started listening instead of reacting, everything shifted."

[INSIGHT/EDUCATION - 2-3 paragraphs, practical + research-backed]
- Key learning or concept
- Why this matters
- How it helps
- HLS perspective (responsive, flexible, parent wellbeing)

Example:
"Your baby isn't just crying at you. They're communicating WITH you. Different cries signal different needs:

• Tired cry: Rhythmic, builds gradually, often with eye rubbing
• Hungry cry: Starts and stops, paired with rooting/sucking
• Uncomfortable cry: Sudden, sharp, usually with physical signs

Learning to decode these cries doesn't mean you'll always get it right. It means you're building a relationship. You're learning your baby's language."

[PRACTICAL ACTION - 1 paragraph, simple next step]
- One thing to try tonight
- Low barrier to entry
- Framed as experiment, not requirement

Example:
"Tonight, before you respond to a cry, pause for 5-10 seconds. Just listen. Notice the tone, the rhythm, the intensity. You don't have to 'do' anything with this information yet. Just practice listening. You'll be surprised what you start to hear."

[REASSURANCE - 1-2 sentences, warm + validating]
- You're doing an incredible job
- This is hard work
- Change takes time
- You're not alone

Example:
"This is a skill, not an instinct. It takes practice. You're learning a whole new language, and you're doing it while exhausted. That's incredible."

[SOFT CTA - 1 sentence, optional engagement]
- Reply and share
- Read more on blog
- Follow on Instagram
- Save this email

Example:
"Reply and tell me: what cry confuses you most? I read every response."

[SIGNATURE]
With you,

[GREETING]
Hi [First Name],

[HOOK - Raw, honest opening]
Example: "I need to tell you something I don't say enough: I was terrified."

[THE STRUGGLE - 3-4 paragraphs, full vulnerability]
- Specific moment or challenge
- How Jade felt (fear, shame, exhaustion, anger)
- What she thought it meant about her
- The lowest point

Example:
"Harvey's 4-month regression hit like a truck. One day he was sleeping 6-hour stretches. The next, he was waking every 45 minutes. I tried everything. Nothing worked.

By week two, I was hallucinating from exhaustion. I snapped at John over nothing. I cried in the shower. I Googled 'is something wrong with my baby' at 3am.

The worst part? I felt like I was failing. Like every other mum had figured this out and I was the only one drowning. I was ashamed to admit how bad it was."

[THE SHIFT - 2-3 paragraphs, what changed]
- Realization or turning point
- What Jade learned or tried differently
- How it felt to make the shift
- What became possible

Example:
"Then my sister Jess said something that changed everything: 'This isn't your fault. It's developmental. Harvey's brain is doing exactly what it's supposed to do. He's not broken. You're not failing.'

I started researching regressions as developmental leaps, not problems. I stopped fighting Harvey's new patterns and started working WITH them. I adjusted wake windows. I lowered my expectations. I asked John to take a night so I could sleep.

Slowly, things improved. Not because I 'fixed' Harvey. Because I stopped treating normal development like a crisis."

[THE LESSON - 2 paragraphs, what this means for reader]
- Key insight
- How this applies to them
- Permission or validation
- HLS philosophy connection

Example:
"Here's what I want you to know: Sleep regressions are not setbacks. They're brain development. Your baby isn't going backwards. They're learning new skills.

And you? You're not failing. You're parenting through one of the hardest phases. That takes strength you don't even realize you have."

[REASSURANCE + INVITATION - 1-2 paragraphs]
- You're not alone
- It won't last forever
- How HLS can support
- Soft CTA (reply, share story, get resource)

Example:
"If you're in the thick of it right now, I see you. I've been there. It's brutal and it's temporary and you're doing an incredible job.

Reply and tell me what's happening. I read every single email. You're not alone in this."

[GREETING]
Hi [First Name],

[HOOK - Pain point or desire]
Example: "You've tried everything. You're exhausted. You just want sleep. I get it."

[AGITATE - 1-2 paragraphs, name the struggle]
- Specific pain points
- What they've already tried
- Why it's not working
- Cost of staying stuck (emotional + practical)

Example:
"You've read the blogs. You've asked the Facebook groups. You've tried 'drowsy but awake' and wake windows and white noise and everything else the internet promised would work.

And yet here you are, still Googling sleep solutions at 2am. Still exhausted. Still wondering why it's so hard.

Here's the truth: generic advice doesn't work because every baby is different. What you need isn't more information. It's a plan built for YOUR baby, YOUR family, YOUR life."

[THE OFFER - 2-3 paragraphs, what you're offering]
- Product name
- What's included (specific, tangible)
- How it's different from free content or competitors
- Why it works

Example:
"That's why we created the [Age-Specific] Sleep Guide.

It's not a one-size-fits-all program. It's a comprehensive, personalized plan for babies aged [X-X] months, covering:

✅ Both HLS methods (Gentle Fade + Quick Reset) so you can choose what fits  
✅ Age-specific wake windows, nap schedules, and developmental milestones  
✅ Troubleshooting for regressions, travel, illness, and life chaos  
✅ Partner alignment tools (so you're working together, not against each other)  
✅ Email support for 2 weeks (ask us anything)  

This is everything we wish we'd had when we were in your shoes."

[DIFFERENTIATION - 1-2 paragraphs, why HLS]
- What makes this different from competitors
- HLS brand pillars (parent wellbeing, responsive methods, flexible)
- Founder authenticity

Example:
"Here's what makes this different from every other sleep program:

We don't just focus on baby. We focus on YOU. Your sleep, your wellbeing, your relationship. Because a rested parent is better for everyone.

And we don't give you one rigid method that falls apart when life happens. We give you flexible, responsive tools that adapt to real life."

[SOCIAL PROOF - 1-2 paragraphs, testimonials]
- 1-2 parent stories (name, age of child, result)
- Specific outcomes (timeline, what changed)
- Emotional transformation (not just sleep metrics)

Example:
"Sarah (mum to 6-month-old Noah) said:  
'I tried Baby Sleep Code first. It was too rigid and I felt like I was failing. HLS met me where I was. The Gentle Fade worked for us, and when Noah got sick, we switched to Quick Reset without guilt. Within 2 weeks, he was sleeping 8-hour stretches. More importantly, I felt supported, not judged.'

Emma (mum to 10-month-old Isla):  
'The partner alignment guide alone was worth it. My husband and I were fighting about sleep constantly. Now we're on the same page. Isla's sleep improved AND our relationship improved.'"

[THE INVESTMENT - 1 paragraph, price + value]
- Price (clear, no hidden costs)
- What it replaces (cost of staying stuck)
- What it makes possible (rested parent, happy baby, stronger relationship)

Example:
"The [Age] Sleep Guide is $XX.

That's less than one night of babysitting. Less than a month of takeout because you're too tired to cook. Less than the cost of endless Googling, trial-and-error, and months of sleep deprivation.

What it gives you: A clear plan. Confidence. Sleep. Your life back."

[STRONG CTA - 1-2 sentences, clear action]
- Action-oriented button text
- What happens next (instant access, email confirmation)
- Reassurance (refund policy if applicable)

Example:
"Ready? Get instant access to the [Age] Sleep Guide now.

[BUTTON: Get the Guide]

You'll receive immediate access via email. Start tonight."

[URGENCY (if applicable) - 1 sentence]
- Time-limited offer
- Quantity limited
- Bonus expiring

Example:
"This bundle offer expires in 48 hours. Don't wait."

[FINAL REASSURANCE - 1-2 sentences]
- Risk reversal (guarantee, refund policy)
- Support availability
- You've got this

Example:
"Not sure? We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee. If it's not right for you, just email us. No questions asked."

[GREETING]
Hi [First Name],

[HOOK - Friendly, low-pressure]
Example: "Just checking in. How are you doing?"

[CONTEXT - 1-2 paragraphs, what's new or relevant]
- Seasonal moment (daylight savings, holidays, back to school)
- Recent HLS update (new blog post, Instagram content, research)
- Trending topic in sleep world
- General check-in

Example:
"Daylight savings is coming up this weekend, and I know that means chaos for a lot of families. Shifting baby sleep by an hour can feel impossible when you've finally got a routine working.

We just posted a full guide on Instagram about how to handle the transition (gradually vs cold turkey, which works for which age), but I wanted to reach out personally too."

[OFFER VALUE - 1-2 paragraphs, quick tip or resource]
- Helpful insight
- Link to blog/Instagram post
- Free resource
- Practical action step

Example:
"Here's the short version:

• For babies under 6 months: Don't stress. Their circadian rhythm isn't fully developed yet. Just shift wake times naturally.  
• For babies 6-12 months: Gradual shift (15 min earlier each day for 4 days before the change).  
• For toddlers: Cold turkey works better. Stick to new time, expect a rough few days, stay consistent.

Full breakdown here: [Link to Instagram post]"

[INVITATION TO ENGAGE - 1 paragraph, optional]
- Reply and share
- Follow on social
- Take a survey
- Ask a question

Example:
"How are you handling it? Reply and let me know. I love hearing what's working (and what's not) for real families."

[SOFT CTA - 1 sentence, no pressure]
- Check out resource
- Follow for more
- Share with someone who needs it

Example:
"If you found this helpful, share it with a friend who's dreading daylight savings as much as you are."

- **Test:** Question vs statement, emoji vs no emoji, personalization vs generic

### Preview Text

- **Fallback:** "Hi there" or "Hi friend" if no name

### Voice Consistency
- **Warm, not corporate:** "We're here for you" not "Our team is available"
- **Conversational, not formal:** "Here's the thing" not "It is important to note"
- **Vulnerable, not perfect:** "I struggled with this too" not "We have the solution"
