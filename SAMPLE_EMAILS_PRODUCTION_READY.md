Hello Little Sleepers 💙
─────────────────────────────────────

Hi there,

I wasn't prepared for the 4-month regression.

One day, Harvey was sleeping 6-hour stretches. The next, he was waking every 45 minutes. I tried everything—longer wake windows, shorter wake windows, more feeds, less feeds, white noise, darkness, swaddle transitions. Nothing worked.

By week two, I was hallucinating from exhaustion. I snapped at John over nothing. I cried in the shower. I Googled "is something wrong with my baby" at 3am.

The worst part? I felt like I was failing. Like every other mum had figured this out and I was the only one drowning.

Then my sister Jess said something that changed everything:

"This isn't your fault. It's developmental. Harvey's brain is doing exactly what it's supposed to do. He's not broken. You're not failing."

I started researching the 4-month regression not as a problem to fix, but as a developmental leap to understand. And here's what I learned:

**What's Actually Happening at 4 Months**

Your baby's sleep cycles are maturing. Newborns sleep in two stages (light and deep). At 4 months, their brains develop FOUR stages of sleep—just like adults.

This is HUGE brain development. And it's messy.

Suddenly, your baby is experiencing more light sleep phases, which means more opportunities to wake up. They're also becoming more aware of their surroundings. They're learning to roll. They're processing so much new information.

Sleep falls apart because their brains are growing.

**This Is Progress, Not a Setback**

I know it doesn't feel like progress when you're on your fifth wake-up of the night. But your baby's brain is doing exactly what it's supposed to do. This is normal. This is temporary.

The 4-month regression usually lasts 2-6 weeks. Some babies breeze through in a week. Others take longer. Every baby is different.

**What Helped Us (and What Might Help You)**

Here's what we did:

✅ **Adjusted wake windows.** At 4 months, Harvey needed 1.5-2 hours of awake time between naps (not the 1 hour we'd been doing). Longer wake windows = better sleep pressure.

✅ **Kept the bedtime routine consistent.** Even when everything else was chaos, we stuck to the same routine every night. Bath, book, feed, bed. It became his anchor.

✅ **Lowered expectations.** We stopped trying to "fix" Harvey. We focused on getting through each night. Some nights, I just held him. That's okay.

✅ **Asked for help.** John took two nights a week so I could sleep. I stopped trying to do it all alone.

✅ **Reminded myself: This won't last forever.** And it didn't.

**You're Not Failing**

If you're in the thick of the 4-month regression right now, I see you. I know how brutal this is. I know you're exhausted. I know you're questioning everything.

You're not failing. Your baby is growing. Their brain is developing. This is hard AND it's temporary.

You're doing an incredible job.

**What to Try Tonight**

If you're struggling, here's one small thing to try:

Check your wake windows. At 4 months, most babies need 1.5-2 hours of awake time before naps, and 2-2.5 hours before bedtime. If you're putting baby down too soon (or too late), it's harder for them to fall asleep.

Try adjusting by 15-minute increments. See what happens.

And if nothing changes? That's okay too. Sometimes, the only way through is through.

**Want More Support?**

Our 5-18 Month Sleep Guide includes a full section on the 4-month regression—what's happening developmentally, how to adjust wake windows and routines, and how to survive the hardest nights.

It also includes both our Gentle Fade and Quick Reset methods, so you can choose what fits your family (and switch if life gets chaotic).

[Learn more about the guide here]

But whether you get the guide or not, please know: You're not alone. You're not failing. This is hard, and you're doing it anyway.

That's strength.

With you,

Hello Little Sleepers 💙
─────────────────────────────────────

Hi there,

Has bedtime suddenly become a battle?

Your 8-month-old who used to go down easily is now fighting sleep. Crying when you leave the room. Waking up more at night. Maybe even standing up in the crib and protesting loudly.

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. And no, you didn't "break" your baby's sleep.

Here's what's actually happening.

**Your Baby Is Learning BIG Things**

Around 8 months, your baby's brain is on fire. They're developing:

• **Separation awareness:** They suddenly realize you exist even when you're not in the room. This is amazing cognitive development. It's also terrifying for them.

• **New physical skills:** Crawling, pulling to stand, cruising. Their bodies are capable of SO much now.

• **Independence:** They're figuring out they're a separate person from you. This is a huge identity shift.

All of this? It makes sleep harder.

**Why This Affects Sleep**

When you leave the room at bedtime, your 8-month-old now KNOWS you're gone. And they're not sure you're coming back. That's scary.

When they wake up at night and you're not there, they want reassurance that you still exist.

And when they've just learned to pull themselves up to standing in the crib? They're going to practice. At 2am. Because babies don't have great timing.

This isn't sleep regression. This is development. And it's normal.

**What Helps (Practical Steps)**

Here's what worked for us when Harvey hit this phase:

**1. Practice separation during the day**

Play peek-a-boo. Leave the room for 30 seconds and come back. Let them see that you always return. This builds trust.

**2. Consistent bedtime routine (even more important now)**

Bath, book, feed, bed. Same order, same time, every night. Predictability = safety for babies navigating big changes.

**3. Responsive check-ins**

If they cry when you leave, go back. Reassure them. "I'm here. You're safe. It's time to sleep." Then leave again. Repeat as needed.

You're not "giving in." You're teaching them that you're reliable.

**4. Let them practice new skills during the day**

If they're pulling to stand in the crib at night, give them LOTS of practice during the day. The more they master the skill in daylight, the less they'll need to practice at 2am.

**5. Adjust wake windows if needed**

At 8 months, most babies need 2.5-3 hours of awake time before naps, and 3-4 hours before bed. If your baby is fighting sleep, they might not be tired enough yet.

Try extending wake times by 15 minutes and see what happens.

**This Phase Is Temporary**

I know it doesn't feel like it when you're doing bedtime for the third time in an hour. But this phase usually lasts 2-4 weeks.

Your baby is learning crucial skills—object permanence, physical independence, emotional regulation. Sleep disruption is the side effect of incredible growth.

And you? You're helping them navigate it. That's hard work.

**You're Doing It Right**

If you're feeling exhausted or frustrated or like you're back at square one, that's completely normal. You're not failing. Your baby isn't broken.

This is just what 8 months looks like.

Keep showing up. Keep being consistent. Keep reassuring them that you're there. They're learning they can trust you.

That's everything.

**Want a Full Plan?**

Our 5-18 Month Sleep Guide has a complete section on the 8-month separation anxiety phase, including:

• Wake window charts for 8-10 months  
• How to handle bedtime battles without giving up  
• Night waking strategies that actually work  
• When to use Gentle Fade vs Quick Reset  

[Get the guide here]

But whether you get the guide or not, please know: you're handling this beautifully, even when it doesn't feel like it.

Small steps forward. You've got this.

With you,

Hello Little Sleepers 💙
─────────────────────────────────────

Hi there,

John and I were fighting about bedtime. Again.

Harvey (2 years old at the time) was testing every boundary. Asking for water. Another story. Another hug. Another song. Bedtime stretched from 7pm to 9pm. Every. Single. Night.

I was exhausted and strict. "No more stories. It's bedtime."

John was exhausted and permissive. "One more won't hurt."

We were undermining each other. Harvey sensed it. And bedtime got worse.

Sound familiar?

**Why Partner Misalignment Makes Toddler Sleep Harder**

Toddlers are SMART. They pick up on inconsistency immediately.

If one parent is firm and the other gives in, they learn to push harder. If parents are sending different messages, they feel less secure (even though it looks like they're "winning").

And when parents are fighting about bedtime? That stress bleeds into the routine. Kids feel it.

Here's the truth: **The sleep method doesn't matter if you're not on the same page.**

You could have the perfect plan. But if one parent follows it and the other doesn't, it won't work.

**The Conversation That Changed Everything**

One night, after Harvey finally fell asleep, John and I sat down. Not to argue. Just to talk.

I asked: "What do you actually want for Harvey's bedtime?"

He said: "I want him to feel loved. I don't want him to go to bed upset."

I said: "I want that too. But I also want him to learn that bedtime is non-negotiable. And I need my evenings back."

We weren't on opposite sides. We just had different fears.

**Here's What We Figured Out**

We created a bedtime plan together. One that honored both of our values.

**Our Toddler Bedtime Agreement:**

✅ **Bedtime routine is 30 minutes, no exceptions.**  
Bath, pajamas, two books, one song, lights out. Harvey could choose WHICH books and WHICH song. But not how many.

✅ **Requests after lights out get ONE response.**  
"I need water" → We bring water.  
"I need another hug" → We give one hug.  
"I need another story" → "We already read stories. It's sleep time now."

✅ **We take turns putting him down.**  
John does Mon/Wed/Fri. I do Tue/Thu/Sat. Sunday we decide based on who's more rested. This way, Harvey doesn't associate bedtime with just one parent.

✅ **We check in every Sunday.**  
"What's working? What's not? Do we need to adjust?"

**What Changed**

Within one week, bedtime went from 2 hours to 45 minutes.

Within two weeks, Harvey stopped asking for endless stories. He knew the routine. He knew we were consistent. He felt secure.

And John and I stopped fighting.

**Why This Matters for You**

If you're struggling with toddler bedtime battles AND partner misalignment, here's what I want you to know:

You don't need a perfect sleep plan. You need a plan you BOTH agree on.

**How to Have This Conversation (Tonight)**

1. **Start with your "why."**  
"What do we both want for [child's] bedtime?"  
You probably want the same things (happy kid, decent sleep, some evening time). Name those shared goals first.

2. **Name your fears.**  
"I'm afraid if we're too strict, they'll feel unloved."  
"I'm afraid if we're too permissive, bedtime will never end."  
Fears are valid. Say them out loud.

3. **Build the plan together.**  
What's the bedtime routine? How long? What happens if they ask for more?  
Decide together. Write it down if you need to.

4. **Agree on who does what.**  
Who puts them down which nights? Who handles wake-ups? Fair distribution matters.

5. **Check in weekly.**  
Plans need tweaking. Schedule 10 minutes every Sunday to talk about what's working.

**This Is the Conversation No One Talks About**

Every sleep expert tells you about wake windows and routines and methods.

No one tells you that partner alignment matters MORE than the method.

But it does.

If you and your partner aren't on the same page, even the best plan will fail.

**Want the Full Partner Alignment Toolkit?**

Our Toddler Sleep Guide (18 Months - 3 Years) includes a complete Partner Alignment section with:

• Conversation guide (questions to ask each other)  
• Bedtime agreement template (fill-in-the-blank)  
• How to handle disagreements without fighting  
• Fair distribution of night duties  

[Get the Toddler Guide here]

It also includes everything else you need for toddler sleep: boundary-setting strategies, bedtime resistance solutions, nap transition support, and both HLS methods (Gentle Fade + Quick Reset).

But whether you get the guide or not, PLEASE have this conversation with your partner.

Tonight. This week. Soon.

Your toddler's sleep will improve. And your relationship will too.

You've got this. Together.

With you,  
Jade (+ John, who finally gets it now 😅)
